# classification-challenge
## Background
Provided with a dataset that contains information about emails, with two possible classifications: spam and not spam. 

Developed a supervised machine learning (ML) model that will accurately detect spam emails so it can filter them out of its customers' inboxes.

Created two classification models to fit the provided data, and evaluate which model is more accurate at detecting spam. 

The models created were a logistic regression model and a random forest model.
